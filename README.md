# ðŸ§  Neural Networks from Scratch

This repository contains implementations of **neural networks from scratch** without using **any external libraries** (such as NumPy, TensorFlow, or PyTorch).  
It focuses on building **deep learning models** using only **pure Python**, covering key concepts such as activation functions, forward propagation, error calculation, and more.
